	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I'm from Covington, Tennessee. I'm going to school for journalism in the hopes 
	 that I can pursue a career in copyediting, whether it be freelance or working for a
	 publisher. I would love to work as an outsource agent for a publishing company.<p>
	<p>I currently work for the Pacer, the UTM newspaper, as Co-News Editor. This is my 
	favorite job because I am getting so much experience in news writing, layout and 
	copyediting.</P>
